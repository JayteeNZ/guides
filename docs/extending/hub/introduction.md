# Introduction

The Admin Hub is a Nuxt.js SPA which is built on multiple different modules. To create a plugin/module for the hub, it's really no different to how you would do it in Nuxt.js. It wouldn't make sense to copy their documentation so refer to their website for the best way to do so.

Of course we do offer some hooks you can tap into to make life easier. These will be detailed on the next page.
