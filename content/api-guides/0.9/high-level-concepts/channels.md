# Channels

## Table of contents

## What are they?

Channels give your store the ability to seperate products, categories and collections into seperate "areas". On a small store you may only ever have one, but on larger stores you could have multiple channels depending on your store needs.

You are able to hide/show resources based on channels, giving you enourmous flexibilty on where and how they displayed.

## How should I use them?

Lets say you have two channels `uk_store` and `us_store`. You may only want certain products to show on the US store as they are not available in the UK. So you would simply "unpublish" that product for the `uk_store` so it doesn't show in search and listings.

## When should I use them?

You should use channels when you have multiple outlets for your store and you need to control what gets displayed on each.
