# API Guides

The purpose of the API guides is to give you an overview of how things are working under the hood. These guides won't go into too much technical detail on how the endpoints work, please see the [API reference](http://api-docs.getcandy.io/) for that.

Whilst we are in Beta, these guides are likely to change so please bear that in mind. If anything drastic changes there will be an upgrade guide provided to make this as painless as possible.

If you find any inaccuracies please let us know as soon as you can and we will get it fixed!
