# What is the GetCandy API?

GetCandy is an open source E-Commerce API, written in Laravel and supplied as a composer package. There are no templates to wrestle with, no caching to contend with and no obscure sessions to deal with. Just a straight up JSON API you can consume with anything that can make HTTP Requests.

The idea was born out of the frustration of a lack of E-Commerce providers that didn't make drastic and opinionated workflows into how you should build your online store, we felt this should be left to who know's best...you!

Since the API is a Laravel package, you just install it via composer into your new or existing app and you're all set. The goal is to provide an E-Commerce solution that you truly can customise and tailor to your exact needs.

## What about the Admin Hub?

The Admin Hub is a first party Nuxt.js SPA that's being developed and maintained by us. As we're working with an API, creating a decoupled admin system for you made perfect sense. It means you can easily scale your API without having to worry about your admin hub being married to your Laravel app.

Once caveat that could be argued is there is a learning curve to getting set up with Nuxt.js & Vue, especially if you're new to these systems, but we believe the benefits are plentiful and we think you'll agree too as you begin your journey with us.

## Sure, but is it production ready?

We've just come out of Alpha and gone into Beta, so there will probably be some glitches and gotcha's you come across, but the team behind GetCandy already has websites running on the platform with good success, we believe you can use this in production. Of course if you have any questions you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6qVWaf) and talk to us directly, we're a friendly bunch :)
