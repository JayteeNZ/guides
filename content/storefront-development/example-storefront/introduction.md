# Example Storefront

The example storefront aims to give you a running start on how to use the Javascript client to create a storefront. It's not designed to be a fully featured store you can just put your logo on, it's here to provide an example of how you can get up and running with the API to create your own store.

Features will be added over time and on request.

This storefront is provided as is, if you have an issue [let us know on the repo](https://github.com/getcandy/example-storefront) and we'll take a look.

## Features

> There is no payment process on the checkout, the checkout just makes an offline payment. There are a ton of different ways you can take payment so trying to fit them all on would be quite intense. If you specifically want a method of Payment shown, create a feature issue on this repo and we can discuss.
