# Storefront Development

It can be quite daunting not knowing where to begin when developing your storefront since GetCandy doesn't provide any templates or storefront preinstalled. Also since you're dealing with only an API you have a bounty of different paths to go down, it really is totally up to you as the developer how you approach it.

We've looked at different approaches you can take and have listed out what we think are some viable options below. One major thing to consider is the impact SEO has when choosing your path.

## Nuxt.js

> Build your next Vue.js application with confidence using NuxtJS. An open source framework making web development simple and powerful.

At GetCandy, we're huge fans of Nuxt, the Admin Hub is even built on it! We believe it's a great framework for Vuejs developers and firmly believe you can create a super fast storefront with GetCandy on this.

## Next.js

> Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

- **Website:** [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Technology:** React
- **Supports SSR:** Yes

Next.js seems to be a top contender with React developers, we have no doubts that you'll be able to create an engaging and fast online store if you choose to use this.

<tool-tip title="Be aware" type="danger">
Although we do have experience in using Next.js we will only be able to provide GetCandy specific support if you use this for your online store, we're not experts with it.

## Laravel

> Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things

- **Website:** [laravel.com](https://laravel.com/)
- **Technology:** PHP

You can opt to use good old fashioned PHP for your store, you absolutely have no obligation to use a decoupled front end, although we do highly recommend it.

## React Native

If you're looking to create a mobile app for your online store, that's very much up to you how you do it. We've built other types of apps with React Native and would have no hesitation using this going forward.
