## Work in progress

The Admin Hub and API are very much a work in progress, we're doing are best to get it up to speed and out of Beta as soon as possible, that said this isn't a speedrun, this is a labour of love so we're very much inclined to take our take to make it the best possible. Thank you for bearing with us!
